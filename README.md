LibGit2 on iOS
==============

Similar to our [LLVM-On-iOS project](https://github.com/light-tech/LLVM-On-iOS) and thank to the experience from that project, this project provides scripts and YAML pipeline to build [LibGit2](github.com/libgit2/libgit2) and its dependencies (OpenSSL, PCRE and LibSSH2) on Azure DevOps (a.k.a. VSTS).
